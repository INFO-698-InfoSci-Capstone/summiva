## Poster Design Tips

1. **Use a Clean Layout**: Organize information in a logical flow (top to bottom, left to right)
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Make the title, architecture diagram, and key features most prominent
3. **Consistent Colors**: Use 3-4 colors that complement your logo
4. **Balance Text and Visuals**: Aim for 40% text, 60% visuals
5. **Font Size Guide**:
   - Title: 85-100 pt
   - Headings: 36-48 pt
   - Body text: 24-32 pt (ensure visibility from 4-6 feet away)
