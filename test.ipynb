IEEE 754 was the first coprocessor specifically dedicated to floating-point arithmetic . it was designed to replace slow library calls with the machine code . now almost every system except some embedded ones supports the floating point format . 32 bits are split into 1-bit sign flag, 8-bit exponent flag, and 23-bit fraction part . this information should be enough for us to start some experiments! 1.0 | 1 can be expressed in binary fluting-point form as 1.0 * 2sup>0 . in IEEE 754 exponent is 1111111 (127 in decimal) and significand is 1 . binary significand has one unique property, except for zero . if a number starts with zero, then it is not normalized . 1.0 | 1 | S: 0 E: 01111111 M: 000000000000000 -1.0 | -1 . 1 is skipped, but it is only 23 zeroes . negative sign just inverts sign flag without touching the rest . for integers, a negative sign is much more complex than flipping one bit! numbers 3 and 5 are represented as 1.1 and 1.01 with a proper exponent . 0.2 should not differ much from them, but it is . 2/3 is 0.666666... it happens because 3 does not have any non-trivial common divisors with 10 (10 = 2 * 5, neither of them is 3) 0.2 can only be represented as infinitely long 0.00110011001100 . 1.0 | 1 | S: 0 E: 01111111 M: 000000000000000 0.22*25 . 0.2 * 0.2* 25 is not the same as 1, and the expression is actually false . zero can never be written in the normalized form because it does not contain any 1s in its binary representation . it uses an exponent value of 0 and significand value of 0. +0 and -0 loosely correspond to the mathematical concept of the infinitesimal, positive and negative . those numbers can represent extremely small values, lesser than the minimum normalized number . a denormalized number has the virtual exponent value of 1, but, at the same time, they do not have omitted 1 as their first dioxyde . denormalized numbers lose precision to store numbers between 2sup>-128/sup . the least possible floating-point number is actually 2Sup>-149 . numbers with the exponent of 11111111 are reserved for the «otherother» 1 / 0 | inf | S: 0 E: 11111111 M: 000000000000000 . it can be achieved by dividing any non-zero number to zero or by getting any number larger than maximum allowed . Infinity / Infinity = NaN Not a Number, or NaN , is, perhaps, the most interesting floating-point value . it can be obtained in multiple ways . power function may return NaN in case of any of those indeterminate forms . any operation involving NaN as any of the operands always returns . ion is min or max: those functions should return the non-NaN argument . actual contents of NaN are implementation-defined; IEEE 754 only requires that exponent should be 11111111, significand should be non-zero . the application decides if it generates quiet NaN or signaling NaN . for example, the GCC C compiler always generates silence unless explicitly specified to behave the other way around . if (a == b) – wrong! – Floating-point numbers lose precision even when you are just working with such seemingly harmless numbers as 0.2 or 71.3 . multiplication is not associative in the world of floating-point arithmetic . a * (b* c) is not always equal to (a * b) * c . additional measures should be taken if you are working with either extremely large values, extremely small numbers, and/or numbers close to zero . bers are approximately 1.175494e-38 to 3.402823e+38 . sometimes, it may spoil program execution beyond recognition . a number of floating-point numbers operations per second, or FLOPS, is perhaps the most well-known . the only downside is that the programmer should be aware of all the pitfalls regarding the precision and floating-point values . we select the best writers to cover interesting and trending topics for our readers .
