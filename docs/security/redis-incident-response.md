# Redis Security Incident Response

## Overview
This document outlines the procedure to respond to security incidents related to Redis instances in the Summiva platform.

## Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Notification |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| P1 | Critical incident with active security breach | Immediate | All team + management |
| P2 | Serious vulnerability, potential for breach | Within 1 hour | Security team + lead |
| P3 | Moderate risk, requires attention | Within 24 hours | Security team |

## Incident Types and Response Procedures

### Cross Protocol Scripting (XPS) Attack

**Indicators:**
- Log entries showing "Possible SECURITY ATTACK detected"
- HTTP-like commands detected in Redis logs
- Multiple failed connection attempts

**Response Steps:**
1. **Contain**: Verify Redis is running in protected mode and with authentication
2. **Investigate**:
   - Check access logs to identify source IP of attack
   - Review Redis logs for timeline of events
   - Verify if any unauthorized commands were executed
3. **Mitigate**:
   - Block source IP at firewall level
   - Verify Redis configuration for proper security settings
   - Rotate Redis password
4. **Document**:
   - Record incident details, timeline, and steps taken
   - Document any system changes made

### Brute Force Authentication Attempts

**Indicators:**
- Multiple failed authentication attempts in logs
- Increased CPU usage from authentication processing

**Response Steps:**
1. **Contain**: 
   - Temporarily restrict access to Redis to known IPs only
2. **Investigate**:
   - Identify source of brute force attempts
   - Determine if any successful accesses occurred
3. **Mitigate**:
   - Implement rate limiting for Redis authentication attempts
   - Update Redis password to a stronger one
   - Consider implementing IP-based access controls
4. **Document**:
   - Record incident details and mitigation steps

### Unauthorized Command Execution

**Indicators:**
- Unexpected data modifications
- Execution of high-risk commands (FLUSHALL, CONFIG SET, etc.)

**Response Steps:**
1. **Contain**: 
   - Temporarily disconnect Redis from public network access
   - Take snapshot of current Redis data
2. **Investigate**:
   - Review command history and logs
   - Identify affected data and services
3. **Mitigate**:
   - Disable dangerous commands in Redis configuration
   - Restore from backup if data corruption occurred
   - Implement additional monitoring for command execution
4. **Document**:
   - Record commands executed, affected data, and recovery steps

## Post-Incident Analysis

After resolving any security incident:

1. Conduct a post-mortem meeting within 48 hours
2. Document root cause analysis
3. Update security procedures based on lessons learned
4. Implement additional monitoring or controls as needed
5. Schedule follow-up review in 2 weeks to verify effectiveness of changes
