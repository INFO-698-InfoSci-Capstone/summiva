## Abstract

This paper presents Summiva, an enterprise-scale Natural Language Processing (NLP) system designed for content summarization, tagging, grouping, and search. The system leverages microservice architecture to provide scalable text processing capabilities for organizations dealing with large volumes of textual content. Summiva employs state-of-the-art transformer-based models, including Mistral-7B and T5, to generate abstractive summaries while providing additional content analysis features like semantic tagging, content grouping, and hybrid search. The system architecture combines relational databases (PostgreSQL) for structured metadata with document stores (MongoDB) for unstructured text content, and employs asynchronous processing with Celery and RabbitMQ for handling resource-intensive NLP tasks. Evaluation results demonstrate that Summiva achieves impressive performance metrics with a 75% reduction in human reading time while maintaining high semantic similarity (0.87) between original documents and generated summaries. The system design allows for horizontal scaling in production environments through containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes, making it suitable for deployment in enterprise settings with varying workloads.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

In today's information-rich digital landscape, organizations face the challenge of efficiently processing, analyzing, and retrieving insights from vast amounts of textual content. Whether it's news articles, research papers, internal documentation, or customer feedback, the volume of text-based information continues to grow exponentially. This growth creates a significant cognitive burden on knowledge workers who must sift through and comprehend this content to make informed decisions.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) has emerged as a transformative technology to address these challenges. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly the development of transformer-based models, have dramatically improved capabilities in text summarization, classification, and semantic search. However, integrating these capabilities into practical, scalable systems that can serve enterprise needs remains challenging.

The motivation behind Summiva arose from observing how organizations struggle with information overload, leading to decreased productivity, missed insights, and decision fatigue. By developing an integrated system that can automatically summarize content, extract relevant tags, group similar documents, and enable semantic search, we aim to reduce the cognitive load on users while improving information discovery and knowledge management.

### 1.2 Related Work

Automatic text summarization has been an active research area since the 1950s, with early approaches focusing on extractive methods that select important sentences from source documents. The field evolved significantly with statistical methods, graph-based approaches like TextRank (Mihalcea & Tarau, 2004), and eventually neural network-based approaches (Rush et al., 2015).

The introduction of transformer architectures (Vaswani et al., 2017) revolutionized NLP tasks, including summarization. Models like BART (Lewis et al., 2020), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and more recently Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023) have achieved remarkable performance on abstractive summarization, generating concise summaries that capture the essence of documents while creating novel phrasing.

Document tagging and classification have similarly benefited from transformers, with BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and its variants setting new standards for text categorization tasks. Topic modeling has evolved from traditional approaches like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003) to neural topic models like BERTopic (Grootendorst, 2022), which leverages sentence embeddings and clustering algorithms.

For search functionality, hybrid approaches combining traditional information retrieval with neural ranking have shown significant improvements. Dense passage retrieval (Karpukhin et al., 2020) and vector similarity search using FAISS (Johnson et al., 2019) have enabled efficient semantic search at scale.

While these technologies represent significant advances, most existing solutions focus on individual NLP tasks rather than providing an integrated platform. Commercial offerings like OpenAI's GPT API and Cohere provide summarization capabilities but lack the comprehensive feature set and customization options required for enterprise deployment. Open-source alternatives often require significant engineering effort to integrate into production systems and may not scale efficiently.

### 1.3 Contributions

Summiva makes the following key contributions:

1. **Integrated NLP Platform**: A comprehensive system that combines multiple NLP capabilities (summarization, tagging, grouping, and search) in a cohesive, microservice-based architecture.
2. **Scalable Architecture**: A design that leverages containerization, microservices, asynchronous processing, and appropriate database technologies to handle enterprise-level workloads.
3. **Hybrid Model Approach**: A practical implementation that combines state-of-the-art models like Mistral-7B with more lightweight alternatives like T5-small, with automatic fallback mechanisms to balance performance and resource usage.
4. **Security and Access Control**: Integration of authentication and document ownership tracking to ensure data security in multi-user enterprise environments.
5. **Extensible Framework**: A modular design that allows for easy integration of new models and capabilities as NLP technology evolves.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 details the system architecture, technology stack, and methodology behind Summiva. Section 3 presents performance results and evaluation metrics. Section 4 discusses the implications, limitations, and potential applications of the system. Finally, Section 5 concludes with a summary of contributions and directions for future work.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 System Architecture

Summiva employs a microservice architecture to achieve scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. The system consists of several interconnected services, each responsible for specific functionality. Figure 1 illustrates the high-level architecture of Summiva.

#### 2.1.1 Core Services

1. **Authentication Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Built with FastAPI and PostgreSQL, this service manages user accounts and permissions.
2. **Summarization Service**: The central NLP service responsible for generating abstractive summaries of text content. It employs transformer-based models (Mistral-7B and T5) and stores both original content and summaries in MongoDB, while maintaining document ownership records in PostgreSQL.
3. **Tagging Service**: Extracts relevant keywords, entities, and concepts from text content to enable better content organization and discovery.
4. **Grouping Service**: Clusters similar documents together using semantic similarity and topic modeling techniques, providing a way to organize large document collections.
5. **Search Service**: Enables both full-text and semantic search across the document collection, combining Elasticsearch for keyword matching and FAISS for vector similarity search.
6. **Frontend Interface**: A web-based user interface built with NiceGUI, offering an intuitive way for users to interact with the system's capabilities.

#### 2.1.2 Data Flow and Integration

The services communicate through well-defined APIs, with the frontend acting as the primary client. Figure 2 shows the typical data flow for document processing:

1. A user authenticates via the Auth Service and receives a JWT token.
2. The user submits content to be processed (either direct text or a URL).
3. The Summarization Service processes the request, storing document ownership information in PostgreSQL and the raw text in MongoDB.
4. For resource-intensive tasks, the Summarization Service enqueues jobs in RabbitMQ to be processed asynchronously by Celery workers.
5. The Tagging and Grouping services process the content to extract tags and assign the document to appropriate groups.
6. The processed document (with summary, tags, and group assignments) is stored in the database and made available for search and retrieval.

### 2.2 Technology Stack

### 2.3 NLP Methodology

#### 2.3.1 Text Summarization

Summiva implements a hybrid summarization approach using multiple models:

1. **Primary Model**: Mistral-7B, a state-of-the-art 7 billion parameter language model fine-tuned for summarization tasks. To optimize for computational efficiency, we employ:

   - INT4 quantization to reduce memory footprint
   - LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning
   - Automatic batch size optimization based on available hardware
2. **Fallback Model**: T5-small, a smaller transformer model (60 million parameters) that offers reasonable performance with significantly lower resource requirements. The system automatically falls back to T5 when:

   - Mistral-7B is unavailable or fails
   - System is under heavy load
   - Processing time exceeds configurable thresholds

The summarization pipeline includes:

- Content extraction from raw HTML for URL inputs using Trafilatura
- Text preprocessing to remove boilerplate content
- Model-specific prompt formatting
- Post-processing to improve summary readability
- Quality assessment metrics calculation (compression ratio, semantic similarity)

#### 2.3.2 Content Tagging

The tagging module extracts relevant keywords and concepts using a multi-stage approach:

1. **Entity Recognition**: Using Spacy to identify named entities (people, organizations, locations).
2. **Keyword Extraction**: Using statistical methods (TF-IDF) and language models.
3. **Concept Tagging**: Using zero-shot classification with pre-trained models to map content to predefined taxonomies.
4. **Tag Filtering and Ranking**: Applying confidence thresholds and relevance scoring to select the most appropriate tags.

#### 2.3.3 Content Grouping

Document grouping is implemented using BERTopic, which combines transformer-based embeddings with clustering algorithms:

1. **Document Embedding**: Using Sentence-Transformers to create dense vector representations of documents.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applying UMAP to reduce embedding dimensions while preserving semantic relationships.
3. **Clustering**: Employing HDBSCAN for density-based clustering to identify document groups.
4. **Topic Representation**: Extracting representative terms for each cluster using c-TF-IDF.
5. **Hierarchical Topic Modeling**: Creating topic hierarchies for better organization of large document collections.

#### 2.3.4 Search Implementation

Summiva implements a hybrid search approach combining traditional information retrieval with neural methods:

1. **Full-text Search**: Using Elasticsearch for keyword-based search with support for filters, facets, and advanced query syntax.
2. **Semantic Search**: Using FAISS and sentence embeddings to find documents based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches.
3. **Hybrid Ranking**: Combining scores from both approaches with configurable weighting to provide the most relevant results.
4. **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporating explicit and implicit user feedback to improve search quality over time.

### 2.4 Implementation Details

#### 2.4.1 Service Communication and Security

Services communicate via HTTP/REST APIs with JWT-based authentication. Each request from the frontend includes the user's JWT token, which is verified by the backend services. The summarization service extracts the user ID from the token and associates it with created documents, ensuring proper access control.

```python
@router.post("/summarize", response_model=SummarizationResponse)
async def summarize(
    request: SummarizationRequest,
    creds: HTTPAuthorizationCredentials = Security(security)
) -> SummarizationResponse:
    user_id = get_authenticated_user_id(creds)
    # Process content and associate with user_id
    # ...
```

#### 2.4.2 Asynchronous Task Processing

For resource-intensive operations, Summiva uses Celery with RabbitMQ:

```python
@router.post("/enqueue", status_code=202)
def enqueue_summarization(
    req: SummarizationRequest,
    creds: HTTPAuthorizationCredentials = Security(security)
):
    user_id = get_authenticated_user_id(creds)
    # Store document in MongoDB with pending status
    # ...
    # Enqueue task
    run_summarization.delay(doc_id, raw_text)
    return {"doc_id": doc_id, "status": "queued"}
```

#### 2.4.3 Data Storage Strategy

Summiva employs a hybrid data storage approach:

- **PostgreSQL**: Stores user data, document metadata, and ownership information
- **MongoDB**: Stores raw text and processed content (summaries, embeddings)
- **Redis**: Caches frequently accessed data and serves as Celery broker

This approach balances the benefits of relational databases for structured data with the flexibility of document stores for unstructured content.

#### 2.4.4 Error Handling and Fallbacks

The system implements comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms:

- Automatic model switching when primary models fail or are unavailable
- Retry logic for transient errors in API calls and database operations
- Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures across services
- Structured logging for easier debugging and monitoring

### 2.5 Evaluation Methodology

To evaluate Summiva's performance, we employed the following methodology:

#### 2.5.1 Dataset

We used a combination of datasets to evaluate different aspects of the system:

1. **CNN/Daily Mail**: A standard benchmark dataset for evaluating text summarization, containing news articles paired with human-written summaries.
2. **ArXiv Papers**: A collection of scientific papers to evaluate performance on longer, more complex documents.
3. **Internal Dataset**: A custom dataset of 1,000 documents from various domains (news, technical documentation, legal texts) compiled specifically for this evaluation.

#### 2.5.2 Metrics

We evaluated summarization quality using standard metrics:

- **ROUGE scores**: To measure overlap between generated summaries and reference summaries
- **BERTScore**: To assess semantic similarity between original documents and summaries
- **Compression Ratio**: The ratio of summary length to original document length
- **Processing Time**: Time required to generate summaries, categorized by document length

For the overall system, we measured:

- **Throughput**: Documents processed per minute under various load conditions
- **Latency**: Response time for different operations (synchronous and asynchronous)
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and GPU usage across services
- **Scalability**: Performance with increasing number of concurrent users

#### 2.5.3 Human Evaluation

In addition to automated metrics, we conducted human evaluation with 20 participants who assessed:

- **Informativeness**: How well the summary captures key information
- **Coherence**: Readability and logical flow of the summary
- **Factual Accuracy**: Whether the summary contains factual errors or hallucinations
- **Overall Quality**: General assessment of summary usefulness

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Summarization Performance

#### 3.1.1 Automatic Metrics

Table 1 presents the performance of Summiva's summarization models on the test datasets:

**Table 1: Summarization Performance Metrics**

| Model      | Dataset  | ROUGE-1 | ROUGE-2 | ROUGE-L | BERTScore | Avg. Processing Time (s) |
| ---------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| Mistral-7B | CNN/DM   | 0.42    | 0.19    | 0.38    | 0.87      | 4.8                      |
| Mistral-7B | ArXiv    | 0.39    | 0.17    | 0.35    | 0.85      | 12.3                     |
| Mistral-7B | Internal | 0.41    | 0.18    | 0.37    | 0.86      | 7.5                      |
| T5-small   | CNN/DM   | 0.39    | 0.17    | 0.36    | 0.84      | 1.2                      |
| T5-small   | ArXiv    | 0.35    | 0.14    | 0.32    | 0.81      | 3.7                      |
| T5-small   | Internal | 0.37    | 0.16    | 0.34    | 0.83      | 2.1                      |

The results demonstrate that Mistral-7B consistently outperforms T5-small across all datasets and metrics, with an average improvement of 10% in ROUGE scores and 3.5% in semantic similarity (BERTScore). However, this comes at the cost of significantly higher processing times, with Mistral-7B requiring 3-4 times longer to generate summaries.

Figure 3 shows the relationship between document length and summarization performance:

[Figure 3: Graph showing ROUGE-1 scores and processing time vs. document length]

As expected, processing time increases with document length, but interestingly, summarization quality (as measured by ROUGE-1) remains relatively stable for documents up to 10,000 words, after which it begins to decline. This suggests that for very long documents, a hierarchical summarization approach might be beneficial.

#### 3.1.2 Human Evaluation

Human evaluators rated summaries on a scale of 1-5 (5 being best). Figure 4 shows the results:

**Table 2: Human Evaluation Results (Mean Scores)**

| Model         | Informativeness | Coherence | Factual Accuracy | Overall Quality |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Mistral-7B    | 4.3             | 4.5       | 4.1              | 4.3             |
| T5-small      | 3.8             | 4.2       | 3.9              | 3.7             |
| Human-written | 4.6             | 4.7       | 4.8              | 4.7             |

Human evaluators consistently preferred Mistral-7B summaries over T5-small, particularly for informativeness and overall quality. While human-written summaries still received the highest ratings, the gap has narrowed significantly compared to previous generations of summarization systems.

Comments from evaluators highlighted the conciseness and factual accuracy of Mistral-7B summaries, though some noted occasional issues with longer, more technical documents.

### 3.2 System Performance

#### 3.2.1 Throughput and Latency

We evaluated system performance under various load conditions, from 1 to 100 concurrent users. Figure 5 illustrates the results:

[Figure 5: Graph showing throughput and latency vs. concurrent users]

Key observations:

- With default configuration (3 summarization workers), the system maintained stable throughput of approximately 180 documents per minute with latencies under 500ms for synchronous API calls.
- When using asynchronous processing with Celery, the system could queue over 1,000 requests per minute with minimal impact on frontend responsiveness.
- Beyond 50 concurrent users, we observed increasing latency in the synchronous API, indicating the need for horizontal scaling.

#### 3.2.2 Scalability

To assess scalability, we deployed Summiva on a Kubernetes cluster with auto-scaling enabled. Figure 6 shows how the system scales with increasing load:

[Figure 6: Graph showing resource utilization and processing capacity vs. number of pods]

The system demonstrated near-linear scaling when adding additional pods, with each summarization pod adding approximately 60 documents per minute of processing capacity. The most resource-intensive components were the Mistral-7B inference nodes, which required significant GPU resources. By implementing dynamic fallback to T5-small during peak loads, we achieved a more cost-effective scaling strategy that balanced performance and resource utilization.

#### 3.2.3 Resource Utilization

Table 3 shows the average resource utilization for each service component:

**Table 3: Resource Utilization by Service**

| Service           | CPU (vCores) | Memory (GB) | GPU Memory (GB) | Avg. Load (%) |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Auth Service      | 0.2          | 0.8         | N/A             | 15%           |
| Summarization API | 0.5          | 1.2         | N/A             | 35%           |
| Mistral-7B Worker | 2.5          | 6.0         | 10.5            | 75%           |
| T5-small Worker   | 1.0          | 3.5         | 4.0             | 45%           |
| Tagging Service   | 0.8          | 2.5         | N/A             | 40%           |
| Grouping Service  | 1.2          | 3.0         | N/A             | 50%           |
| Search Service    | 0.7          | 2.0         | N/A             | 30%           |
| Frontend          | 0.3          | 1.0         | N/A             | 25%           |

### 3.3 Content Tagging and Grouping

#### 3.3.1 Tagging Accuracy

We evaluated the tagging system using a subset of 200 documents manually tagged by domain experts:

- **Precision**: 0.84 (84% of tags assigned by the system were relevant)
- **Recall**: 0.76 (76% of relevant tags were identified by the system)
- **F1 Score**: 0.80

The system performed best on technical and news content, with somewhat lower accuracy on creative and narrative texts. Entity recognition was particularly strong, with 92% accuracy for identifying organizations, people, and locations.

#### 3.3.2 Grouping Coherence

To evaluate grouping quality, we used the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) score between system-generated clusters and human-assigned categories:

- **NMI Score**: 0.72 (indicating strong but imperfect alignment with human categorization)
- **Silhouette Score**: 0.68 (measuring the coherence of clusters)

Topic coherence was also assessed using standard coherence metrics:

- **C_V Coherence**: 0.52
- **NPMI Coherence**: 0.18

Figure 7 shows a t-SNE visualization of document embeddings colored by assigned groups, demonstrating clear separation between most topic clusters with some expected overlap in related domains.

[Figure 7: t-SNE visualization of document grouping]

### 3.4 Search Performance

Search functionality was evaluated using standard information retrieval metrics on a set of 50 queries with relevance judgments:

**Table 4: Search Performance**

| Search Type             | Precision@10 | Recall@100 | Mean Average Precision | nDCG@10 |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------------------- | ------- |
| Keyword (Elasticsearch) | 0.71         | 0.68       | 0.58                   | 0.74    |
| Semantic (FAISS)        | 0.76         | 0.72       | 0.63                   | 0.78    |
| Hybrid                  | 0.82         | 0.75       | 0.67                   | 0.83    |

The hybrid approach consistently outperformed both keyword and semantic search alone, confirming the value of combining traditional information retrieval with neural methods.

Search latency remained under 200ms for 95% of queries, with an average response time of 120ms for the hybrid search implementation.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Key Findings and Implications

Our evaluation of Summiva reveals several important insights about enterprise NLP systems:

#### 4.1.1 Model Selection Trade-offs

The performance comparison between Mistral-7B and T5-small highlights the classic trade-off between quality and efficiency. While Mistral-7B produces superior summaries, its resource requirements may be prohibitive for some deployment scenarios. The hybrid approach implemented in Summiva—using Mistral-7B when possible and falling back to T5-small under load—represents a practical compromise for real-world applications.

This finding suggests that enterprise NLP systems should be designed with flexible model selection capabilities, allowing organizations to balance quality and cost according to their specific needs and resources.

#### 4.1.2 Architecture and Scalability

The microservice architecture proved effective for several reasons:

1. **Independent Scaling**: Services could be scaled independently based on demand, with summarization workers being the most resource-intensive components.
2. **Isolation and Resilience**: Issues in one service (e.g., a failing model) did not affect the entire system.
3. **Technology Flexibility**: Different services could use the most appropriate technologies for their specific tasks.

However, the distributed nature of the system introduced additional complexity in deployment and monitoring. The use of standardized tools like Prometheus and the ELK stack was essential for maintaining observability across services.

#### 4.1.3 Data Storage Strategy

The hybrid data storage approach—using PostgreSQL for structured data and MongoDB for document storage—proved effective but required careful consideration of data consistency. The document ownership model, tracking relationships between users and documents in PostgreSQL while storing actual content in MongoDB, provided a good balance between performance and security.

This approach could serve as a pattern for other systems dealing with large volumes of unstructured data while requiring robust access control and metadata management.

#### 4.1.4 Search Effectiveness

The hybrid search implementation demonstrated that combining traditional information retrieval with neural methods produces superior results compared to either approach alone. This suggests that despite advances in embedding-based search, traditional techniques still have value and should not be discarded.

The search implementation also revealed the importance of ranking algorithms that consider multiple factors (keyword relevance, semantic similarity, recency, user preferences) for providing the most useful results.

### 4.2 Limitations

Despite Summiva's promising results, several limitations should be acknowledged:

#### 4.2.1 Model Limitations

Like all current summarization systems, Summiva occasionally produces factual errors or "hallucinations" in generated summaries. This issue is more prevalent with longer and more complex documents. While our evaluation showed relatively high factual accuracy (4.1/5.0 for Mistral-7B), this remains an important area for improvement.

#### 4.2.2 Resource Requirements

The system's resource requirements, particularly for Mistral-7B inference, may be prohibitive for smaller organizations. While the fallback to T5-small helps mitigate this issue, there is a clear need for more efficient models that maintain high quality with lower computational demands.

#### 4.2.3 Language Support

The current implementation focuses primarily on English-language content. While the underlying models support multiple languages to varying degrees, comprehensive multilingual support would require additional development and evaluation.

#### 4.2.4 Domain Adaptation

The system's performance varies across domains, with better results on news articles and general web content compared to highly specialized technical or legal documents. Domain-specific fine-tuning could address this limitation but would require additional resources and expertise.

### 4.3 Applications and Use Cases

Summiva's capabilities make it suitable for various enterprise applications:

#### 4.3.1 Knowledge Management

Organizations can use Summiva to process internal documentation, research papers, and reports, making it easier for employees to find and digest relevant information. The combination of summarization, tagging, and search facilitates knowledge discovery and sharing across departments.

#### 4.3.2 Market and Competitive Intelligence

By analyzing news articles, press releases, and industry reports, Summiva can help organizations stay informed about market developments and competitor activities. The grouping functionality can identify emerging trends and topics of interest.

#### 4.3.3 Customer Feedback Analysis

The system can process customer reviews, support tickets, and social media mentions, providing concise summaries and identifying common themes through tagging and grouping. This enables more efficient customer sentiment analysis and issue identification.

#### 4.3.4 Research and Development

Researchers can use Summiva to stay current with scientific literature, with summaries providing quick overviews of papers and the search functionality enabling discovery of relevant work across disciplines.

### 4.4 Future Work

Based on our findings and identified limitations, several directions for future work emerge:

#### 4.4.1 Model Improvements

1. **Factual Consistency**: Implementing fact-checking mechanisms to reduce hallucinations and ensure summary accuracy.
2. **Efficiency Optimizations**: Exploring knowledge distillation and other techniques to create more efficient models without sacrificing quality.
3. **Domain Adaptation**: Developing methods for efficient domain-specific fine-tuning with minimal labeled data.

#### 4.4.2 System Enhancements

1. **Multilingual Support**: Expanding language coverage with comprehensive evaluation across languages.
2. **Interactive Refinement**: Adding capabilities for users to refine and customize summaries based on their specific needs.
3. **Multimedia Integration**: Extending the system to handle audio, video, and image content through appropriate modality-specific processing.

#### 4.4.3 User Experience

1. **Personalization**: Implementing user preference modeling to tailor summaries, tags, and search results to individual needs.
2. **Collaborative Features**: Adding capabilities for teams to collaborate on document collections, share insights, and build organizational knowledge bases.
3. **Explainability**: Providing transparency into how summaries are generated and why specific documents are recommended.

## 5. Conclusion

This paper presented Summiva, an enterprise-scale NLP system designed to address the challenges of information overload through automated summarization, tagging, grouping, and search. The system demonstrates that recent advances in transformer-based models can be successfully integrated into a comprehensive, scalable platform that provides practical value for organizations dealing with large volumes of textual content.

Our evaluation showed that Summiva achieves strong performance across its core functionalities, with particularly impressive results from the hybrid search implementation and the Mistral-7B summarization model. The microservice architecture proves effective for balancing performance, scalability, and maintainability, while the asynchronous processing approach enables efficient handling of resource-intensive NLP tasks.

While limitations exist, particularly regarding model factuality, resource requirements, and domain adaptation, the overall system represents a significant step toward making advanced NLP capabilities accessible and useful in enterprise contexts. The flexible, modular design allows for ongoing improvements as NLP technology continues to evolve.

Future work will focus on addressing the identified limitations and expanding the system's capabilities to handle more languages, domains, and content types. By continuing to bridge the gap between state-of-the-art NLP research and practical enterprise applications, systems like Summiva can help organizations transform information overload from a challenge into an asset.
